TODO for Slotsim GUI: 
(in order or priority)


*********DONE************************
x slotsim logo in simulation excel file (logo_excel.png in \tools\excelgen and \client\style\images)
+ About window should be real window instead of dialog box|some preparation in progress...
+ more consecutive simulations based on input (comma separated: 10000,10000,10000) Vesna
+ Spin events in single play cannot dissappear after going to console tab
+ merge simulation excel files after generation
+ generate excel file from simulation
+ ipc for communication with child process:
+ How to rename repository name? 
X integration of react-json-view|integrated and later removed, hence not useful
+ General: make folder path for working directory + example: D:\Gameart\Slotide

+ Single play: Inject Randoms: TEXTFIELD
++ Single play, simulation: button SPIN|what value shoud it set?
    + spawns a child process (e.g. node test.js)
    + first parent sends "start" signal
    + test.js does something then returns some value to the parent (testing progress value return)
    + spawn child --> parent sends start to child --> child finishes and returns some result
    + child writes log.txt file and let's see if refresh on the console works!|done in simulation only

+ Simulaton add debugger checkbox
+ Simulation Number of paylines instead Pay line
+ Simulation: Inject Randoms: TEXTFIELD
+ Simulation: electron-store onDidChange function
++ Simulation: progress indicator|where is it gonna get the value from? --> child process when running.
++ Simulation: RTP return to player + Field read only|where is it gonna get the value from? child
++ Simulation: STD standard deviaton  + Field read only|where is it gonna get the value from? child
++ Simulation: RUN button|what value shoud it set? also start another child that returns values above.
++ Simulation: STOP button|what value shoud it set? none for now. child cannot be interrupted! - Button ready anyway
+ Simulation: Thicker progress bar and percentage indication| I dont feel like the bar is not thick enough, percentage is there

+ Console: make it resizable, (dynamic size)
+ Console: clear button - delete log file content
+ Console: refresh button
+ "General" Tab will contain buttons "Start Game Server", "Stop Game Server"
+ implement electron-store as global persistent data store
+ Console window that writes content also to file - Lazylog. 
+ "General" Tab will contain button "Select file", which opens select window and returns reference to selected file.
+ Simulation tab need options: number of games #, payline #, credit per line #, threads #, verbose BOOL, generate excel BOOL
+X How to do "Select File" Dialog box in electron? We need to select file and use it!|Dialog logs the path for now,
 we can use that somehow...
+ 3 tabs main window for "General",  "Single Play" and "Simulation"
+ Help Menu, Open Devtools
+ Help Menu, About Dialog box popup with version
